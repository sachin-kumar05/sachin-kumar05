## About Me

I am a dedicated computer science student with a strong interest in **full-stack web development** and **data structures & algorithms**. I enjoy understanding systems from the ground up — whether it’s how a backend API works internally, how databases optimize queries, or how algorithms scale with constraints.

I focus on writing **clean, maintainable code** and continuously improving my problem-solving skills by learning fundamentals deeply rather than relying on shortcuts.

## Learning Philosophy

- Fundamentals first, frameworks second  
- Readable code > clever code  
- Debugging is a skill, not a problem  
- Consistency beats intensity
