## 🧑‍💻 About Me

I am a dedicated computer science student with a strong interest in **full-stack web development** and **data structures & algorithms**. I enjoy understanding systems from the ground up — whether it’s backend API design, database internals, or algorithmic optimization.

I focus on writing **clean, maintainable code** and continuously improving my problem-solving skills by learning fundamentals deeply rather than relying on shortcuts.
